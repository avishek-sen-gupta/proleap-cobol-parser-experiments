# Parsing fixups needed

- Not accepting multiple VALUE(s) combined with THRU
- Y2000+ markers at the tail end of a COPY IDMS STATEMENT
- Line Number - continuation lines ' ' -> comments / print statements getting mangled by lexer
- weird line numbers at the end of a valid line
- ATTACH THE DATABASE RESOURCES
- line just saying ["FILLER" redefined a larger item]
- READY...USAGE-MODE syntax
- BIND syntax
- Y2000M annotations
